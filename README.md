This is an old project where I explored reverse-engineering Spotify’s old app using Python and Kivy.  

The app implements **basic features** such as:  
- Managing playlists  
- Playing songs  
- Exploring music  

> Note: The app is **not fully finished**. Some features are incomplete, and the code was written a while ago, so it may not reflect my current coding style or best practices.  

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Kivy (GUI framework)
- Spotipy (Spotify API wrapper)

## Commit History
This repository contains only the **initial commit** and the **latest version** of the project. Intermediate commits were not maintained, as the code was not originally intended for public release.
